Hi,
Im Faizal from Malaysia. Just ordered Raspberry PI and waiting to reach me. Saw this link today on your mag, great effort but if can have more image (more pictures) view would be great. Thanks.

Hi
I am a Pi owner and just today found out about the magazine. I am planning on starting at issue 1 however I would have found it sooner had it been on Zinio (http://za.zinio.com/) I use this android app to read all my magazines. So if you can publish it there, it would be awesome, and I can get the updates the moment the next one comes out.
Regards

Hi
Your magazine is great, im using it to teach python to my kids.
One possible suggestion, would it be possible to produce a .mobi or .epub version, as this would save paper, and i could just put all the magaines on the kindle for them to read and copy from.
Kind Regards
Adam

Hello,
while I enjoy reading the MagPi, I’d like to read it on my Kindle, if you already offer that as an electronic download. The two columns layout is a pain to read on the kindle.
Would you concider one of the following options:
1.       Master the MagPi for one column half-size-pages PDF
2.       Create an edition for the Amazon Kindle shop
Thanks in advance
Kirill

Dear Editor
If only a magazine had existed in the early days of the Sinclair ZX80 my life would have been so much easier.
My Raspberry Pi is due to be delivered by Santa but I have your excellent magazine to keep me informed and interested till then.
Many thanks for an excellent and innovative magazine.
Cheers
