FIRST PROGRAM (HTML writer):
============================
"The first example... a html web page." should be "...an html..."

You have a note to avoid " but use them throughout, ie:
# Note: avoid using " quotations, use instead '
f.write("<html>"+"\n")
etc
I think you mean avoid using " for both python start-end strings and for surrounding values in HTML but this is unclear from the above note.

I have a little issue with:
f.write("<font face='verdana' color='#000000'>"+"\n")
as this is teaching the novice not to use HTML stylesheets. This would be better written as an inline style on a <p> tag.
Same with using <b> tags later. Use <em> with a style is better.

These lines:
f.write("<h3>A Subheading</h3><p>"+"\n")
f.write("This is the text of the first paragraph.<p>"+"\n")
should end in </p> not <p>

This line:
f.write("<b><a href='http:www.themagpi.com'>WEBSITE</a></b><p>"+"\n")
should be "http://www" not "http:www"

These lines:
f.write("<b><a href='mailto:editor@themagpi.com'>EMAIL</a></b><p>"+"\n")
f.write("<b><a href='http:www.themagpi.com'>WEBSITE</a></b><p>"+"\n")
should end in </p> not <p>

SECOND PROGRAM (Fading titles):
===============================
I think this is called a list in Python, not an array?
settings = [] # Create a variable array to hold the settings


This program appears to end in an if statement:
if nexttitle>=4: nexttitle=1
I think the last lines of the program are missing.
